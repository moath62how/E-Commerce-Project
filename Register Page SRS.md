### **Register Page SRS**

#### 1. **Introduction**

* **Purpose**: The Register Page allows new users to create an account by providing their email, password, and phone number. This page will handle the registration process and ensure that all provided information is valid before allowing the user to register.
* **Scope**: This page will be used for creating a new user account, including the registration of a valid email, password, and phone number. Once registered, the user will be redirected to the login page.

#### 2. **Functional Requirements**

1. **User Registration Form**:

   * **Email Field**:

     * A field for the user to input their email.
     * **Validation**: The email must be in a valid email format (e.g., [user@example.com](mailto:user@example.com)).
     * **Error Message**: Display an error if the email format is invalid or already in use.
   * **Password Field**:

     * A field for the user to input their password.
     * **Validation**: The password must be between 8 and 22 characters long.
     * **Error Message**: Display an error if the password is empty or doesn't meet the required length.
   * **Phone Number Field**:

     * A field for the user to input their phone number.
     * **Validation**: The phone number must be a valid format (e.g., +1234567890, with an optional country code).
     * **Error Message**: Display an error if the phone number is empty or in an invalid format.
   * **Submit Button**:

     * A button to submit the registration form.
     * Upon submission, validate all fields (email, password, phone number). If validation is successful, the user is registered and redirected to the login page.

2. **Error Handling**:

   * If any field is left empty, display a specific error message indicating the missing field.
   * If the **email** is already in use, display an error message ("This email is already registered").
   * If the **phone number** is already registered, display an error message ("This phone number is already registered").
   * If the **password** doesn't meet the required length, display an error message ("Password must be between 8 and 22 characters").
   * If any field fails validation, show the respective error message below the relevant input field.

3. **Success Handling**:

   * Once the user successfully registers, display a success message and redirect the user to the login page.

#### 3. **Non-Functional Requirements**

1. **Performance**:

   * The Register Page should load within 3 seconds under normal internet conditions.
2. **Usability**:

   * The registration form should be easy to use with clear labels for all fields.
   * The layout should be minimalistic, with no unnecessary distractions.
   * **Responsive Design**: The form should be fully functional and accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
3. **Security**:

   * The page must securely handle passwords (hashed) before storing them in the backend.
   * Use **HTTPS** to ensure the secure transmission of user credentials.
   * The phone number must be securely stored in the backend.
4. **Accessibility**:

   * The page should be screen-reader friendly and support keyboard navigation.
   * Ensure that all form fields are properly labeled for accessibility.

#### 4. **Design Constraints**

1. **Layout**:

   * The form should be centered on the page for visibility and easy access.
   * Use a **blue, yellow, and white** color scheme to match the branding of the platform.
2. **Error Messages**:

   * Error messages should be displayed below the respective field and in a noticeable format, preferably in red or a color that stands out.
   * Error messages should be concise and clear (e.g., "Please enter a valid email" or "Password must be between 8 and 22 characters").

#### 5. **Dependencies**

* **Backend System**: The registration page will depend on the backend system to store the user’s details (email, password, and phone number).
* **Authentication System**: The registration system needs to integrate with the authentication mechanism to ensure proper validation and account creation.
