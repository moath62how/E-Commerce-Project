### **Home Page SRS (Updated)**

#### 1. **Introduction**

* **Purpose**: The Home Page serves as the initial landing page for users after logging in. It provides options for navigating to other sections of the platform, including starting a new test and reviewing past test analytics.
* **Scope**: This page will include links to the main sections such as **New Test** and **Past Test Analytics**, and will be the user's starting point after login.

#### 2. **Functional Requirements**

1. **Navigation Buttons**:

   * **New Test Button**: Directs the user to the page where they can create and start a new test.
   * **Past Test Analytics Button**: Takes the user to a page showing analytics and statistics for past tests.
2. **User Role Handling**:

   * The page should show appropriate navigation options based on the user’s role:

     * For **regular users**, only the **New Test** and **Past Test Analytics** buttons should be visible.
     * For **admin users**, the **Past Test Analytics** button should also be visible.
3. **Welcome Message**:

   * A **personalized welcome message** should be displayed, such as:

     * *"Welcome, \[User Name]!"* for a regular user.
     * *"Welcome, Admin!"* for an admin user.
4. **Responsive Design**:

   * The page should be responsive, ensuring that the buttons and content are appropriately sized and accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

#### 3. **Non-Functional Requirements**

1. **Performance**:

   * The page should load within 3 seconds under normal internet conditions.
2. **Usability**:

   * The layout should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
   * The design should prioritize user experience, using clear labels for buttons and actions.
3. **Security**:

   * Only authenticated users should be able to access this page.
   * The page should ensure no unauthorized users can access this page by enforcing proper authentication checks.

#### 4. **Design Constraints**

1. **Layout**:

   * The page should have a clean, minimalistic design, with a clear distinction between the buttons.
   * Use a **blue, yellow, and white color scheme** to align with the project's branding.
2. **Navigation**:

   * All links/buttons should be clearly labeled to avoid any confusion about their purpose.
   * The **buttons** should be prominently displayed and easy to click or tap.

#### 5. **Dependencies**

* **Authentication System**: The Home Page will require an existing authentication system to ensure users are logged in before accessing this page.
* **Backend System**: The Home Page needs to be connected to a backend system to handle role-based content and the display of navigation options.
